                                 Genetic distances can be seen as summary
                                 statistics because they take the whole data
                                 set (for example, data from SNP loci) and

                                 is Nei's genetic distance which measures

                                 the basis of their genetic identity, namely

                                 between populations. For our data set, we
                                 have defined gene pools as populations in the
                                 genind object called LimaBeanData2.

                                 the genind object (in this case on the basis
                                 of the gene pool) to define the populations.

                                 This approach is convenient when we are more
                                 interested in describing the diversity

                                 functions, DAPC needs the groups to be known a
                                 priori and in many cases we just do not know
